# SpringMVC

Java Spring MVC App using: spring context, spring core, spring beans, spring web mvc, javax servlet and hibernate.

This is a project of my spring mvc study, using spring 5.2.21.RELEASE

To run this project better use the newest version of IntelliJ IDEA, JDK 1.8_x, and Tomcat 9.0.62

If you've got any problems caused by this upgration, better look up the documents in Spring Framework Reference.

Firstly, when you start this application with Tomcat, you will see this simple web-page:

Then you need to click on underlined text, to open next view:

Enter some information and click "Send/Отправить". Then you will see view with all information that you have passed:

That was my first app to learn spring and related technologies.
